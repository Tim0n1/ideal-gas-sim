# Gas Dynamics Simulation
This simulation models the behavior of two gas systems, represented by particles, within a confined 2D space. The particles interact through elastic collisions, exchanging momentum and energy. The simulation tracks important thermodynamic properties such as temperature and entropy, providing a visual representation of these physical concepts.
